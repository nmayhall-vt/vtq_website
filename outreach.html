                            <h2> Annual VTQ High-school Summer School </h2>
                            Summer schools play an important role in recruiting and educating students, while also offering a valuable means to develop community and science identity. While several QISE summer schools are offered at the graduate level and mostly focus on physics students, the annual <a href="QIS_summer_school.html">VTQ High-School Summer School</a> targets earlier education levels and a wider student pool spanning multiple disciplines. This summer school, which first launched in Summer 2021, is a four-day virtual event that covers a range of topics within QISE, including superposition, entanglement, quantum gates and circuits, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Josza and Grover’s search algorithm, and more. Students gain familiarity with these topics by working through a series of pen-and-paper exercises using a pictorial formalism first introduced by Prof. Terry Rudolph in his popular book <a href="https://www.qisforquantum.org/">Q is for Quantum</a>. Students also use cloud quantum processors and simulators made available by <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/">IBM</a> to work through problems. More details about the summer school and the topics covered using the pictorial formalism can be found in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07874">arXiv preprint</a> and also in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02868">preprint on Hello Quantum World!</a>. In addition to students, the event is also open to high-school teachers and other interested parties looking to gain a hands-on understanding of basic QISE concepts.

                            <h2> Other VTQ Outreach </h2>
                            VTQ members also participate in annual outreach activities hosted by the VT College of Engineering’s <a href="https://eng.vt.edu/ceed.html">CEED program</a> and by the <a href="https://www.science.vt.edu/get-involved/outreach.html">College of Science</a>. VTQ has also partnered with the American Physical Society <a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/physicsquest/">PhysicsQuest program</a> to develop K-12 QISE learning modules.
